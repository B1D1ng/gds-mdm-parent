# AI Documentation Directory

## Purpose

This directory contains documentation specifically designed to help AI assistants (like Cline, GitHub Copilot, ChatGPT, etc.) understand the GDS-MDM-Parent project structure, architecture, and workflows. The files in this directory provide context that enables AI tools to give more accurate and relevant assistance when working with this codebase.

## How to Use with Cline

Cline is configured to automatically use this directory through the `.clinerc` file at the project root. When working with Cline, you can reference this documentation by mentioning:

```
Please reference the documentation in the docs/ai directory to understand the project structure.
```

## How to Use with Other AI Assistants

When working with other AI assistants, you can:

1. **Provide direct links** to specific documentation files in this directory
2. **Copy relevant sections** from these files into your prompts
3. **Reference the directory structure** to help the AI understand the project organization

## Documentation Files

This directory contains the following documentation files:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `project-overview.md` | High-level description of the project, its purpose, and main components |
| `architecture.md` | Description of the system architecture, including component relationships and data flows |
| `tech-stack.md` | List of technologies, frameworks, and libraries used in the project |
| `key-files.md` | List of the most important files in the project with brief descriptions |
| `glossary.md` | Project-specific terminology and abbreviations explained |
| `development-workflow.md` | How to build, test, and deploy the application |

## Maintaining This Documentation

To keep this documentation useful:

1. **Update regularly**: When significant changes are made to the project structure or architecture
2. **Keep concise**: Focus on high-level information that helps understand the project
3. **Use standard formats**: Markdown is preferred for compatibility with various tools
4. **Cross-reference**: Link between documents to create a cohesive knowledge base
